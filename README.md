# NBA Players statistics simulator - API and Web Scraping with Selenium 

# Overview
Implement a Dataset of Nba players from Kaggle, through an API with tokens to add information regarding the role of the players on the pitch.
Selenium will be used to retrieve all player statistics relating to points scored, assists, rebounds.
Browsing through the pages of NBA.com, this python library will be able to recover this precious information.

# How run the program?
To run the program, it is necessary to call it from the terminal in the following way: python3 main.py and add the flags with the arguments:
in this case two NBA players. 

The program will show in the terminal as an example the statistics of each player of the points scored by year of activity.
Two csv will be exported, one containing detailed statistics and the other one the example of how the initial query of the dataset has been updated with the new information.
5 graphs will be the result of the analysis, and will show points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks
